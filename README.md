# A Data Link layer serial protocol

Written primarly for communication between Arduino and PC but,
I believe, can be used in any applications (if suitable, see *Key feautures* below)

## Key features :

- Byte stuffing

## Acknowledgments

This protocol is based on the article : https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/08/12/framing-in-serial-communications/

_To be continued..._
